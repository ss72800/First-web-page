  <h2>How I started web coding</h2>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">Febuary 25th, 2021
  <p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>TODAY</strong> started learning HTML coding
    from YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvc8kv-i5fvFTJBFAk6n1SA" target="_blank" title="나도코딩 YouTube">"나도코딩"</a>
    and this is <u>my very first web page</u>
  <p><img src="coding.jpg" width="60%">
  <p style="margin-top:20px;">I am just so excited that I made web page and write
    something on it hahaha
  <br>i majored in sociology and minored in psycholoy,
  so i am not familier with coding and all the programing stuff.
  <br>However, I realized that i need to educate myself more to get a job in my
  homecountry.
  Therefore, I started to learn coding from today.
  <br>My instructor told me that HTML coding is the easist one to start learning
  codings. So here I am!!</p>
